Question 16.19 - Cracking the Coding Interview
Pond Sizes

You have an integer matrix representing a plot of land, where the value at that 
location represents the height above sea level. A value of zero indicates water. 
A pond is a region of water connected vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The 
size of the pond is the total number of connected water cells. Write a method to 
compute the sizes of all ponds in the matrix.

Examples

Input:

0 2 1 0
0 1 0 1
1 1 0 1
0 1 0 1

Output: 2, 4, 1 (in any order)

Ideia: Passar pela matriz, assim que identificar 0 encontra os limites e salva
valores em um set

for x in len(land):
    for y in (lenland:
        i[]
