Question 3: The Egg Drop Problem

Question 6.8 - Cracking the Coding Interview

There is a building of 100 floors. If an egg drops from 
the Nth floor or above, it will break. If it's dropped from 
any floor below, it will not break. You're given two eggs. 
Find N, while minimizing the number of drops for the worst case.

Solutions:
 - Brute force: 100 drops
 - Binary search: 50 drops
 - Going from 10 in 10 floors
   Worst case scenario is breaking only on the 100th floor and
   having to go from floor to floor starting from the 91th
   Worst case: 19 drops

Worst case definition:
 From the moment an egg breaks, you need to go from the last floor
 you tested, going up one floor at a time
 The worst case scenario is going until the 100th floor

 If you start at a floor x, worst case scenario is:
 100 / x + (x - 1)

 However, it doesnt need to be linear.
 We need to balance amount of drops
 x + (x-1) + (x-2) ... + 1 > 100
