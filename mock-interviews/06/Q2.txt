Question 2: Jugs of Water

Question 6.5 - Cracking the Coding Interview

You have a five liter jug, a three liter jug, and an unlimited supply 
of water (but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly 
four liters of water? Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that 
filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

Steps:
 - Fill 3L jug
 - Pour 3L in 5L jug
 - Fill 3L jug
 - Pour 2L in 5L jug (filling 5L jug and having 1L remaining in small jug)
 - Empty 5L jug
 - Pour 1L in 5L jug
 - Fill 3L jug
 - Pour 3L in 5L jug
